        <p><b> OED. </b></p>
        <p> O stranger, learning from this maid, who sees<br>
        Both for herself and me, that thou art come<br>
        With c</p>
        
        <p><b> ATHENIAN. </b></p>
        <p>Ere thou ask more, come forth from where thou sittest!<br>
        Ye trench on soil forbidden human tread.</p>
        
        <p><b> OED. </b></p>
        <p>What soil? And to what Power thus consecrate?</p>
        
        <p><b> ATH. </b></p>
        <p>None may go near, nor dwell there. ’Tis possessed<br>
        By the dread sisters, children of Earth and Night.</p>
        
        <p><b> OED. </b></p>
        <p>What holy name will please them, if I pray?</p>
        
        <p><b> ATH. </b></p>
        <p>‘All seeing Gentle Powers’ the dwellers here<br>
        Would call them. But each land hath its own rule.</p>
        
        <p><b> OED. </b></p>
        <p>And gently may they look on him who now<br>
        <span style="color: red;">Implores them</span>, and will
         <span style="color: red;">never leave this grove!</span></p>
